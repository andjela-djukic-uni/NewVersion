            <p>Dear Park Istra, <break>
            you have opened new doors to me and I’m forever grateful for everything…I’ll miss eating breakfast, lunch and dinner with everyone. I’ll miss random workshop nights where we make bracelets, falafels and mozarella cheese. I’ll miss the morning circles in which we share our thoughts and feelings. I’ll miss working with the local community and try talking to them despite of our language barriers…
            Thank you for being yourself and for sharing your stories, goal and passions. You are all very inspirational and I can’t wait to continue this journey at home in which I will try to go back to the basics and live a simple, efficient life.
            Thank you! It’s not a good bye, just a see you later. I was meant to be here and I know I’m meant to come back.</p>

            <p>I will begin first by thanking Petra + Janez for the amazing time I have spent here. Words can
                not describe my experience here. Not only have I learnt so much but I have gained so many life
                changing skills that I will take home with me. Park Istra has taught me the real beauty of life and the humility and kindness of humanity. Everybody has been so kind + welcoming and it has been so powerful to learn about each individual’s journey. I have gained so much that I can not write, but I am not leaving here the same person I arrived, I am much better and my mindset has completely changed.
                Thank you everyone that has contributed to this transition, I am forever in your debt,</p>

            <p>Guys,
I am so glad to spend time here! I didn’t expect to learn so much and to find again my creativity. This place inspired me and will inspire new people, I hope. It shows me also that if you want to live in a certain way it is possible if you have the motivation and the energy. I would like to thank Petra and Janez for this positive attitude which is extremely contagious. I felt like home as soon as I arrived and I am grateful for that. It was the best internship in my entire life. Thank you everyone!</p>

            <p>…I believe that Park Istra is conquering every heart in a different way. In my case, I love being surrounded with good hearted people and share my moments with them. That makes even the most boring task or job wonderful. And somehow I believe that the “magic” of Park Istra comes from the good hearted people in there. So thank you all, for sharing your time with me and for making those 10 days the most special days in my life.
With all my heart,</p>
