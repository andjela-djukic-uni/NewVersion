    <p>If you need help or know someone who might need help from volunteers, please contact us!</p>
    <p>Volunteers are available Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (early hours during the summer). 
        If you have the possibility of transportation, 
        please come to pick them up at the Volunteer Center at the address Kastelec 21, 6275 ÄŒrni Kal.</p> 
        <p>The volunteers come mostly from other European Union countries and all speak English. 
            If you need someone who speaks Slovenian, please let us know. Please note that the volunteers are 
            highly motivated but mostly young and inexperienced, so please be patient with them. It is very important 
            that you explain well what you expect from them and that you work with them and 
            supervise their work. Also explain to them why your work is important, as this will motivate them even more.</p>
