        <h1>Petra Matos, founder</h1>
            <p>Petra Matos, the founder of Park Istra,
                was for many years the president and founder of the association Ecologists Without Borders.
                During her presidency, the association became the most recognizable environmental NGO in Slovenia.
                In 2010 and 2012, she led the Let’s Clean Slovenia in one Day and Clean Slovenia 2012 projects.
                The latter connected 300,000 volunteers in a single day and went down in history as the largest
                environmental volunteer project in the history of Slovenia. In 2010, Petra became the Name of the Year.
                In 2011, she acted as Ambassador of the European Year of Volunteering. In 2012, she continued her studies
                of geography with a focus on environmental protection with postgraduate studies in Partnership and Marriage
                Therapy. In 2019, she was the recipient of a state award for outstanding achievements in the field of
                volunteering. She wrote several books and articles to rise ecological awareness among Slovenes.
                In recent years, she has been working as a volunteer coordinator in Park Istra,
                for which she has received several awards. She has been a mentor to around 1,200 volunteers,
                mostly young people with fewer opportunities. She has shared her experience of working with young people
                at many conferences. She addressed the difficulties faced by young people during their stay in Park Istra by
                developing a “Park Istra Hosting Model”,
                a set of different methods for connecting and empowering young people.</p>
