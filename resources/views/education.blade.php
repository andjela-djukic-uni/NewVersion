        <p>Park Istra is an engine of non-formal education. Volunteers learn through a wide variety of work experiences,
        cooperation with other volunteers and with locals of all ages. In addition, 
        we organize regular workshops for volunteers, visitors and local residents, such as:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>afternoon workshops for volunteers;</li>
            <li>workshops for children and the elderly;</li>
            <li>student practices for students from different countries.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The purpose of our educational activities is:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>to offer the transformative experience of selfless work for others;</li>
            <li>to teach practical skills;</li>
            <li>to offer new opportunities to vulnerable groups of population;</li>
            <li>to raise awareness and disseminate good practices;</li>
            <li>to promote Istria, its beauty and its culture.</li>
         </ul>
